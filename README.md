# Latex style files for Political Science journals

This repository gathers various Latex style files that formats an article according to journals' guidelines.

# Usage

1. References formatting: `filename.bst`. Put `\bibliographystyle{filename}` before the end of the document.
2. Article formatting

- `filename.cls`: Put `\documentclass{filename}` in the preamble.

See inside the style file for additional usage notes.

# Contribution

Pull requests are most welcome. Please indicate in the style file the packages and settings are to satisfy which requirement (either of the journal of your own). This helps users understand and customize your style file to fit their needs.

If you find discrepancies between journals' guidelines and the style files, please file a Github issue with link to the journal's guidelines.
